# Photo Storage Tutorial Part 2
## Writing Unit Tests for your Ionic 2 app

### **DISCLAIMER**

_Because Angular 2 is still putting out release candidates at this time (2016-08-23), some of what you see may not be applicable to whatever version is currently out when you read this.  I'll try to update this article when I can if/when a definite testing strategy is put out by the angular team._

## Intro

> GitHub repo for this tutorial at https://github.com/dually8/Ionic2-Workshop

Hopefully, everything worked out for you in the [previous post](/2016/08/18/Ionic2Tutorial). Now, we want to focus on writing some unit tests. I'll go through everything step-by-step again and (hopefully) explain the _how_ and _why_ to you well. Let's begin.

## The Tech Stack

First, I want to take a look at the tech stack we're using. Here's what we'll be using:

- Jasmine, for writing tests
- Karma, for running tests
  - browserify, a node module loader for browsers
  - istanbul, for code coverage
    - isparta, makes istanbul ES6 compatible
- [Optional] PhantomJS, a headless browser in which to run the tests

## Bootstrapping tests

Granted, this part has already been done for you, but I want to take a look at _how_ it all works together. Let's start by opening up `test/common-providers.ts`. The top is similar to our previous `import` statements, but we have a slightly different collection here this time.

```javascript
import { provide, Type }                              from '@angular/core';
import { Control }                                    from '@angular/common';
import { Http, HTTP_PROVIDERS }                       from '@angular/http';
import { MockBackend }                                from '@angular/http/testing';
import { App, Config, Form, NavController, Platform } from 'ionic-angular';
import { Camera }                                     from 'ionic-native';
import { CameraMock, ConfigMock, NavMock }            from './mocks';
```

Here, we're gathering everything we need to `import` to every test we run. Below this we have two exported arrays: `baseProviders` and `serviceProviders`. It's in these arrays that were going to gather all our requirements for each test we'll run. Doing it this way makes bootstrapping new tests a lot quicker and will save us time. In between the `import` and `export` statements, we have this line:

```javascript
/**
 * Because promises take a long time some times
 */
jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 20000;
```

We write this because:
1. We're writing our unit tests in Jasmine
2. When we use the `async` wrapper later to test asynchronous calls, we want to give it a bit more time to complete so that our tests don't fail.
  - **Note**: the timeout interval is in milliseconds, so 20000 would be 20 seconds.

Let's take a closer look at what the two exported arrays are

```javascript
export let baseProviders: Array<any> = [
    Form,
    provide(Config, { useClass: ConfigMock }),
    provide(App, { useClass: ConfigMock }),
    provide(NavController, { useClass: NavMock }),
    provide(Platform, { useClass: ConfigMock }),
    provide(Camera, { useClass: CameraMock }),
    HTTP_PROVIDERS,
];

export let serviceProviders: Array<any> = [
    provide(Http, { useClass: MockBackend }),
].concat(baseProviders);
```

Granted, this might make a bit more sense once we get into writing our first unit test, but real quick, let me explain what we're doing here. These arrays will be used for dependency injection later. The `provide` function allows us to inject dependencies that will be mocked. This is super useful when testing things like Http calls.

The next thing I want to look at is `app/providers/firebase-provider/firebase-provider.spec.ts` (AKA: the first test we'll be writing). Again, let's take a quick look at the `import` statements.

```javascript
import { addProviders, async, inject } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { provide } from '@angular/core';
import { serviceProviders } from '../../../test/common-providers';
import { FirebaseProvider } from './firebase-provider';
```

The first three things we import (`addProviders, async, inject`), come from Angular's testing framework. These are going to let us inject dependencies efficiently (though, that part may be up for debate until they finish their testing documentation). We're also importing `serviceProviders` from the `common-providers` file we looked at a moment ago, and since we're going to be testing the `FirebaseProvider`, it only makes sense to import that as well.

Below the imports, we have a little guy, `specProviders`. Basically, he's going to hold all the dependencies we need to inject in order to get our tests to work. Some times, this will just be our `baseProviders` or `serviceProviders`, but in most cases, we'll need a couple more things in order to get everything to work. In this case, we need to inject `FirebaseProvider` since we'll be testing it, so we come away with something like this:

```javascript
let specProviders = serviceProviders.concat([
    FirebaseProvider
]);
```

Here, we're putting all of the base dependencies, service dependencies, and one more specific dependency into a single array for us to use at a later point. Below this, we have our first `describe` block.

```javascript
describe('FirebaseProvider', () => {

    const config = {
        // todo: put your own stuff here
        apiKey: '',
        authDomain: '',
        databaseURL: '',
        storageBucket: '',
    };

    firebase.initializeApp(config); // call ONLY ONCE

    // ...
});
```

From the Jasmine documentation a `describe` block says
> A test suite begins with a call to the global Jasmine function `describe` with two parameters: a string and a function. The string is a name or title for a spec suite â€“ usually what is being tested. The function is a block of code that implements the suite.

Or, TL;DR - Name your test block.

Inside the function part, we have our config and initializer. Go ahead and copy/paste your credentials into that config object, because you'll need it for later. Next, let's take a look at the `beforeEach` block and the first `it` block (AKA: the first test case).

```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
    addProviders(specProviders);
});

it('should be defined', async(inject([FirebaseProvider], (_fb: FirebaseProvider) => {
    // todo: complete this test
})));
```

Real quick, before we hit the `beforeEach`, let's look at the `it` block. The `it` block is similar to the `describe` in that we have 2 parameters: a string, and a function. The string is the name of the test you want to give it, and the function will contain the stuff you want to test. The `async` is a wrapper that tells the `it`'s function call that this particular call is asynchronous. The `inject` takes two parameters: an array of providers to inject, and the function to call. Normally, you'd list the providers as parameters in the function call. This will hopefully make more sense as we go along.

The `beforeEach` block is a nifty little tool that executes what's inside of it each and every time _before_ a test runs (an `it` block runs). In our case, we're using `addProviders` to add an array of injectables (AKA: providers/services) before each test runs. *Note: `addProviders` is deprecated and it's recommended to use the [TestBed](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/4a740f23a447d7201fe655e2f016b70066752ec1/modules/%40angular/core/testing/testing_internal.ts#L121) now. As I said in the disclaimer above, this stuff is still being worked out by the Angular team.*

Now, inside of the `it` block, we want to make an assertion. We can do this by calling [`expect`](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html#section-Expectations). An `expect` statement takes a single parameter that is then chained with the actual assertion. You can read a full list of these in the Jasmine documentation. Meanwhile, you can just trust that I'm making the correct assertion calls. Let's fill in the first test like so:

```javascript
it('should be defined', async(inject([FirebaseProvider], (_fb: FirebaseProvider) => {
    // todo: complete this test
    expect(_fb).toBeDefined();
})));
```

If it wasn't already obvious, we're making sure that `_fb` is defined. This is always a good first test because we want to make sure all of our injection things are working correctly. If you like, go ahead and run the test by running `npm test`. Hopefully, you get an output similar to this.

For now, don't worry about the skipped tests. I'll throw in some tricks at the bottom of the tutorial if you're curious as to how I skipped the others. If this didn't work for you, feel free to put in an issue [here](https://github.com/dually8/Ionic2-Workshop/issues). If it did, great! Let's continue.

The next test _should login with email_. So, let's write this one. Since it's an asynchronous test, we need the `async` wrapper again. Your test should look something like this: 

```javascript
it('should login with email', async(inject([FirebaseProvider], (_fb: FirebaseProvider) => {
    _fb.loginWithEmail('test@test.com', 'test123')
        .then((user) => {
            expect(_fb.isAuthenticated).toBe(true);
        });
})));
```

Now, the username and password you pass in may be different. This is just a test account I made on my particular app in order to complete this unit test. Go ahead and run your test again and make sure it passes. If it times out, try increasing `jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL`. If that doesn't work for you, let me know by opening up an issue on this post's repo.

Hopefully, things worked out for you and/or you just want to continue. The next test I want to look at is `app/pages/upload-page/upload-page.spec.ts`. As always, we have our `import` statements at the top, an array of providers below that, and a `describe` block to tell karma that this is a brand new bag of tests to run. You may have noticed a couple of different things this time around:

```javascript
describe('UploadPage', () => {
    let page: UploadPage;
    let pageDep: any[] = [NavController, ModalController, ActionSheetController, ToastController, FirebaseProvider];

    beforeEach(() => {
        addProviders(specProviders);
    });

    // ...
```

This time, we're making two variables at the top of our `describe` block. One is to hold the class object we'll be testing, and the other is an array that holds the stuff we put into the pages constructor. Looking back at the upload page class...

```javascript
export class UploadPage {

    // ...

    constructor(
        public navCtrl: NavController,
        public modalCtrl: ModalController,
        public actionSheetCtrl: ActionSheetController,
        public toastCtrl: ToastController,
        private fbProv: FirebaseProvider) {
    }

    // ...
```
Notice that the same stuff we have in the `pageDep` array is the same stuff in the constructor for `UploadPage`. The biggest reason I've done that here is because I try my best to follow the DRY principle. Otherwise:

```javascript
// this line 
it('should be defined', inject(pageDep, (_nav, _modal, _action, _toast, _fb) => { // ...

// would be this line
it('should be defined', inject([NavController, ModalController, ActionSheetController, ToastController, FirebaseProvider], (_nav, _modal, _action, _toast, _fb) => { // ...
```

Ekk. I'd like to avoid that. Let's move on to writing the first test.

```javascript
it('should be defined', inject(pageDep, (_nav, _modal, _action, _toast, _fb) => {
    // todo: complete this test
    page = new UploadPage(_nav, _modal, _action, _toast, _fb);
    expect(page).toBeDefined();
}));
```

In this case, we're constructing the `UploadPage` and checking to make sure it constructed successfully. This may seem like a useless test, but it's a good first test just to make sure everything is working properly. Let's now move to the next test.

```javascript
it('should call getPicture if takePic is called', async(inject(pageDep, (_nav, _modal, _action, _toast, _fb) => {
    // todo: complete this test
    page = new UploadPage(_nav, _modal, _action, _toast, _fb);
    spyOn(page, 'getPicture');
    page.takePic();
    // because `getPicture` is a private function, we have to check it this way
    expect(page['getPicture']).toHaveBeenCalled();
})));
```

In this case, we're using an `async` wrapper because of the type of calls we'll be making. We're also constructing a brand new `UploadPage` per normal unit testing guidelines. The next line of code might be unfamiliar to you. The Jasmine function `spyOn` takes two arguments: the object you're "spying on", and the name of the function inside of the object that you want to watch. In our case, we're looking inside `UploadPage` (or `page`) and watching for `getPicture` to be called. The next line, we call `takePic` which should later call the private function `getPicture`. Next, we make the assertion (or, `expect`) `getPicture` has been called. Hopefully, it passes for you.

Last page to go is `ViewPage`, so let's get to it.

```javascript
import { addProviders, async, inject } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { provide } from '@angular/core';
import { LoadingController, NavController } from 'ionic-angular';
import { baseProviders } from '../../../test/common-providers';
import { FirebaseProvider } from '../../providers/firebase-provider/firebase-provider';
import { ViewPage } from './view-page';

let specProviders = baseProviders.concat([
    FirebaseProvider,
    LoadingController
]);

describe('ViewPage', () => {
    let page: ViewPage;
    let pageDep: any[] = [NavController, LoadingController, FirebaseProvider];

    beforeEach(() => {
        addProviders(specProviders);
    });

    it('should be defined', inject(pageDep, (_nav, _load, _fb) => {
        // todo: complete this test
    }));
```

Similarly to the previous page's test suite, we have our `import` statements at the top, an array of providers/services we'll need next, a variable to hold our constructed page, and an array of dependencies for said page. The first test will look just like the last page's.

```javascript
it('should be defined', inject(pageDep, (_nav, _load, _fb) => {
    // todo: complete this test
    page = new ViewPage(_nav, _load, _fb);
    expect(page).toBeDefined();
}));
```

Easy enough? Starting to get the hang of it? I hope so. The next couple of tests are a little be weird looking, but here's my implementation for the second test.

```javascript
it('should call FirebaseProvider.getPics when ViewPage.getPhotos is called', async(inject(pageDep, (_nav, _load, _fb: FirebaseProvider) => {
    page = new ViewPage(_nav, _load, _fb);
    spyOn(_fb, 'getPics').and.returnValue(new Promise((resolve) => {resolve(['pics']); }));
    page.getPhotos()
        .then(() => {
            expect(_fb.getPics).toHaveBeenCalled();
        });
})));
```

The first line should look familiar, and at least part of the second line. On the second line, we're "spying on" `FirebaseProvider.getPics`, but since we don't want to actually connect to firebase (we just want to test the functionality of this method), we say `.and.returnValue` to tell Jasmine that we want to re-write and mock the `getPics` function. Because we're only interested in resolving the promise, we just say `new Promise((resolve) => { resolve(['pics']); })`. Essentially, we're just saying that `FirebaseProvider.getPics` should return a string array containing `["pics"]`. Now that we have that mocked, we can call `page.getPhotos` and make the assertion that our `FirebaseProvider` should have called its `getPics` method. Hopefully, that worked out for you.

The next test is similar. Check out my implementation below.

```javascript
it('should return one pic', async(inject(pageDep, (_nav, _load, _fb: FirebaseProvider) => {
    page = new ViewPage(_nav, _load, _fb);
    spyOn(_fb, 'getPics').and.returnValue(new Promise((resolve) => {resolve(['pics']); }));
    page.getPhotos()
        .then(() => {
            expect(page.myPhotos[0]).toBe('pics');
        });
})));
```

Again, we're mocking the `FirebaseProvider.getPics` method to return a string array with one element. Because `ViewPage` should be storing all the strings it gets back from its `getPhotos` call, we check to see if `page.myPhotos` contains the same thing we mocked above in the `FirebaseProvider.getPics` call. Hopefully, that, too, worked out for you. 

Well, that's the end of it. I hope you learned something, and I hope I explained things well enough for you. I recently added [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments on here, so feel free to leave me a comment if something didn't make sense to you. I'll try my best to explain it better. Thanks for reading.

### Notes

Here's a few neat little tricks Jasmine provides for you

- [`fit`](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/focused_specs.html): Run just this test. If two or more are labeled with `fit`, all with that label will run.
- [`xit`](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html#section-Pending_Specs): Disable (or skip) this test. 
- [`fdescribe`](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/focused_specs.html): Run just this suite. If two or more are labeled with `fdescribe`, all with that label will run.
- [`xdescribe`](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html#section-Disabling_Suites): Disable (or skip) this suite. 

You can find more in the Jasmine Documentation.

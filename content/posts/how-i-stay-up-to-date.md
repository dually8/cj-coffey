Technology is an industry much like medicine. If you're not constantly learning, you're falling behind and potentially causing harm to your customers/patients. As a software engineer, there are a handful of things I do to try and stay up-to-date with tech and trends in the industry.

## YouTube

This is probably the biggest and easiest one to do, though, you'll need to find "your people". I subscribe to a few channels that are either generic in their software content, or highly focused.

1. [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship)
   - This is by far my favorite dev channel on YouTube. The [_in 100 Seconds_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0vfts4VzfNiI1BsIK5u7LpPaIDKMJIDN) series is fantastic and has personally helped me discover new tech and got me interested in trying new things. They also have a handful of tutorials that are easy to follow. They recently started a new series, [_The Code Report_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0vfts4VzfNjnYhJMfTulea5McZbQLM7G) that I highly recommend. It's both entertaining and thought-provoking.
2. [Ali Spittel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AliSpittelDev)
   - Ali's channel is a terrific resource if you're getting started in frontend development. Her tutorials are easy to follow, and I feel like they're really good "real world" type apps, unlike a lot of tutorial fluff you see out there. She has an accompanying blog post for all of her videos [here](https://welearncode.com/).
3. [LevelUpTuts](https://www.youtube.com/c/LevelUpTuts)
   - This channel is like if Fireship didn't have any jokes and did more, in-depth looks at different tech. This channel is how I learned how to use Sketch for UI/UX design when I was first starting out. Granted, I 1) No longer have a mac, and 2) Probably couldn't remember how to use Sketch at this point. At least I still remember the principles of design, and, you know, that's probably what really matters at the end of the day.
4. [ArjanCodes](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArjanCodes)
   - Arjan was instrumental to me when I was learning Python. I like his style of videos, and he does a great job at explaining various concepts.
5. [Modern Vintage Gamer](https://www.youtube.com/c/ModernVintageGamer)
   - While this isn't a programming channel, per se, I love when he does deep dives into various game consoles' development environments and such. Like when he [talked about how the Game Boy achieves a parallax effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQE1K074v3s).

## Blogs

Blogs are a bit more difficult to keep up with because no one uses RSS readers anymore. Even still, there's a handful I check at least weekly to help stay up-to-date on things.

1. [Scott Hanselmann](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/)
   - If you're in software development for more than a few months, you know about Scott Hanselmann. He's practically a celebrity in the tech space, and his blog and YouTube channel make it very apparent _why_. He has posts and videos on a wide variety of topics, and he's able to distill them down into something that's both sugar-free and digestible.
2. [Dev.to](https://dev.to/)
   - This is a great place to see trends in the market. Anyone with an account can share anything here, which can be a blessing and a curse, though, I think it's healthy to have a wide range of thoughts and opinions so that we can discuss and debate them.
3. [Morning Dew](https://www.alvinashcraft.com/)/[Morning Brew](https://blog.cwa.me.uk/)
   - Both of these sites don't host any posts themselves, rather, they list a ton of other recent blog posts, podcasts, videos, etc. I find it helpful to check both of these out every morning rather than try and hunt down something useful somewhere else. It's a nice, curated collection of things for me.

## GitHub

Last but not least, the [GitHub trending page](https://github.com/trending). It makes me sad that this one will be going away soon, because it's probably my most used resource. Basically, GitHub tracks how many stars (think "likes") have been given to a repo, and they show you the most starred repos for the day. I find it extremely helpful to see what other developers in the open source community are gravitating towards in a given week. It lets me know what tech I should try out and experiment with.

## Conclusion

These are the resources I use to help stay up-to-date. What about you? How do you stay up-to-date with things as a developer? Anything I should check out that I haven't listed here? Let me know in the comments below. Hope you all have a terrific day! âœŒ

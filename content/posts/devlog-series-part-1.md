Welcome back, everyone. It's certainly be a minute. I apologize. I had all of the video games to play and blogging seemed like such a drag. I'm back now, though, due to some inspiration given to me by my new manager at work. Let's talk about a few things.

1. I'm not going to release any of the content from my previous post, if it was not already obvious. For what it's worth, I had some of the posts written out, but I never published them because I didn't think the work was good enough to publish.  Whether or not that's true or just my depression talking, who's to say?
2. I have a couple of projects in the work, and I plan on posting more about those, _plus_ some hidden ‚ú®bonus‚ú® content as well. I'll give you a taste below, but bare with me for the duration of these other bullet points.
3. I've re-done my site to use Hugo instead of Hexo, and I may end up re-doing it again with NextJS and/or Apollo. Why? A couple of reasons:
   - The old site was _so_ 2016, and we've had a pandemic since then, and I've purchases a lot of more sweat pants since then.
   - It was getting hard to maintain. Even though I didn't post anything, I'd re-deploy the site every 6 months or so to keep the certificate fresh and everything. But the initial design and code was from 2016 and I couldn't be bothered to `npm audit` that junk, so here I am.
   - While this is still kind of "the easy way out" for creating a blog, I kind of wanted a fresh start without having to completely re-write everything. Having said that, Hugo still feels like magic in the same way Hexo was, so I'm going to eventually re-write this thing again so that this kind of stuff isn't so black boxed to me. (i.e., _Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è not ü™Ñ _)

## Now on with the show

Okay, so here's the part you've been waiting for. I'll first give a TLDR, then I'll post the stuff, then the long story below it. So, after the pictures, you can leave if you don't care about the full story.

TLDR: I'm having a house built and in the mean time, I'm making it "playable" using Unreal Engine.

_TODO: PUT IN PICTURES OF HOUSE AND RENDER_

So basically, here's the order of events.

- Pandemic hit, wife and I want to get out of the state
- We sell our house, "move" to VT
- We rent an AirBnB while trying to find a house or apartment for a month.
- Literally nothing is available (wtf)
- We make the decision to move back to TN
- We look for houses for 2 months while living in an apartment.
- Every house we get out bid and/or someone pays a million bucks in cash (wtf)
- We get tired of the rat race and decide, "well, if we're going to be spending a bunch of money for a house, we might as well get our dream home"
- We find a builder and a neighborhood and get started a few months later after meeting them.

After a few months of literally nothing happening with the house, we finally got the framing done and a roof üò¨. When the framing was going on, it inspired me to pick back up this project I started a few months prior, which was "I want to be able to see my finished house _now_." So that led me to asking the designed for the 3D model files so I can chuck that into unreal engine and make something out of it. I'm roughly 75% done with it at this point, but as you know, that last 20-25% is the most amount of work. I'm really proud of the progress I've made, even though it runs like crap and doesn't "play" very well. I still learned _a lot_ working on it, and my wife seems to like it alright, so I can't complain too much.

Anyways, thanks for reading if you got this far. I plan on posting some more dev logs about this project and a few more in the coming months. I hope you stick around for that. Take care ‚úå.

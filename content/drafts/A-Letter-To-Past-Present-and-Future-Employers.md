## TLDR

I almost always undersell myself because, 1) I hate bragging, and 2) I am, and I can see how ironic it is saying this, one of the most humble individuals you will ever meet.

## What I Like About Interviewing

- Meeting new people
- Hearing about their business
- Learning how they improve the lives of their customers
- _BONUS_ If you tell me how you're struggling, that gives me hints on how I can best help you and fit into your company. Don't shy away from this. No one is perfect and no one expects anyone to be such.

## What I Dislike About Interviewing

- The expectation of perfection
- The expectation that you'll hire a "rock star" developer.
- "Gotcha questions", or oddly specific questions about a framework, library, or programming language.
- How long and drawn out the process is
- Why do I have to wait 6 weeks just to be told "no"?
- Do you want me to be realistic? or do you want me to come across as borderline arrogant?
- Whiteboard questions. Why?
- Technical interviews that don't allow me to demonstrate my strategies
- The expectation that I'll be incredible at something I have no experience in and have never been given the opportunity to get experience in.
  - The "experience" loop
    - "We need someone with experience." -> "How do I get experience?" -> "Get hired by someone that will give you experience." -> "But no one will hire me without said experience."
- I have 6+ years experience in programming. Do you think I was just on social media the whole time? Or do you think I can actually code and do the work?


## How I Think This Process Could Be Better

- Let me demonstrate my knowledge by doing something tangible.
- Let me show you or tell you about my work.
- No whiteboard. Let's make something tangible.
- Set expectations early. Don't leave me guessing how your company functions in and outside of interviews.
  - What do you expect me to answer in the interview?
  - What do you expect me to do/work on if/when I get hired?
-

## TLDR

After getting over some odd hurdles, I really like the experience of using Astro. It really _really_ helps to start thinking more in plain ol' HTML, CSS, and JS terms than the "yet another JavaScript framework" terms. It's not like React/Vue/Svelte/Angular/etc. It's more so something like Jekyll.

I recently started a new project, the [Tamadachi Egg Price Tracker](https://github.com/dually8/tamadachi-egg-tracker). This project was born out of the current [eggflation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/02/04/egg-price-increase-history/78063370007/) going on. My wife does most of the grocery shopping, and she often goes to a few different stores to get everything we need. The problem she would run into is that some stores would sell eggs cheaper than the others, but it wasn't until she'd already purchased eggs from one of the more expensive stores that she'd run into some that were less expensive. My goal here was to run a cron job on my desktop to check egg prices every few days and put that information in a site I can host locally at home. That way, we could check to see who sells them the cheapest before making the mistake of buying the more expensive eggs while out shopping. I also wanted to be able to track prices over time so we can try and see trends. So far, this project is roughly a week old, so I don't have much data to compare against, but I have seen a couple of price drops in that time, so that's been neat to see. The site still needs a lot of work done on the UI front because I want to make something that appeals to my wife's aesthetic. Functionally speaking, it's more or less where I want it to be.

Here's a screenshot of what it looks like at the time of writing.

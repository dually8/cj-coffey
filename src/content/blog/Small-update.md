I realize it's been almost a year since I've posted anything on here, so I thought I'd give a little bit of an update for any readers I may have.

Late last year, I moved further away from the city because the area I was living in was infested with giant roaches. Earlier this year, I got engaged to my girlfriend of 5 years, and we're getting married this November. I also got a new puppy as well back in February. He's a ball of energy and taking up most of my time these days. So, basically, between having to drive an hour back and forth from work, plus new responsibilities, I haven't been able to do all the things I've been wanting to do programming-wise. Having said all that, I'm going to try and get back into the groove of things this summer since most things kind of die down during this time. Below is a list of stuff I'm planning on doing/posting/etc. in the next few months.

- Jenkins Build Server CI Tutorial
- React Native Getting Started
  - Possible touch on Redux as well
- Unit testing in React Native
- Update the Ionic 2 workshop to Ionic 3/Angular 4
- Update the Resume section of my site
- Re-style site
- ???

Let me know in the comments below if there is anything else you'd like to see. In the meantime, [enjoy this imgur album of my new dog.](http://imgur.com/a/MIyc0)
